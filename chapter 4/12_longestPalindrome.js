// For this challenge, we will look not only at the entire string provided,
// but also at the substrings within it. Return the longest palindromic
// substring. Given "what up, daddy-o?", return "dad". Given "uh... not
// much", return "u". Include spaces as well (i.e. be strict, as in
// previous challenge): given "Yikes! my favorite racecar erupted!",
// return "e racecar e". Strings longer or shorter than complete words
// are OK.
// Second: re-solve the above problem, but ignore spaces, tabs,
// returns, capitalization and punctuation. Given "Hot puree eruption!",
// return "tpureeerupt".

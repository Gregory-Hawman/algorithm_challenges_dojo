// Without using the .length property that is present on all arrays,

// the element at a certain numerical index was undefined.
// Unfortunately, we can’t do that here because the keys don’t have
// any sort of predictable order or first value.
// So, for object { band: "Travis Shredd & the Good Ol’ Homeboys",
// style: "Country/Metal/Rap", album: "668: The Neighbor of the Beast"
// }, you should return the value 3, because there are three keys in this
// object: band, style and album.

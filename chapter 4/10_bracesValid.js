// Given a sequence of parentheses, braces and brackets, determine
// whether it is valid. Example: "W(a{t}s[o(n{ c}o)m]e )h[e{r}e]!" =>
// true. "D(i{a}l[ t]o)n{e" => false. "A(1)s[O (n]0{t) 0}k" => false.
// Strings like "Able was I, ere I saw Elba" or "Madam, I'm Adam"
// could be considered palindromes, because (if we ignore spaces,
// punctuation and capitalization) the letters are the same when
// reading from the back to the front.

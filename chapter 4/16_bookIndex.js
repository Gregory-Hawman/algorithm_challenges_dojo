// Martin is writing his opus: a book of algorithm challenges, set as
// lyrics to a suite of a cappella fugues. Some of ‘those fugueing
// challenges’ are less popular than others, so he needs an index.
// Given a sorted array of pages where a term appears, produce an
// index string. Consecutive pages should form ranges separated by a
// hyphen. For [1,13,14,15,37,38,70], return string "1, 13-15, 37-38, 70".
// Take care to get all the commas and spaces correct: Martin is
// palpably particular (practically persnickety!) about patchy
// punctuation.

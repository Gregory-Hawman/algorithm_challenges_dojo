// String.slice(start,end) - extract part of a string and return in a new
// one. Start and end are indices into the string, with the first character
// at index 0. End param is optional and if present, refers to one
// beyond the last character to include.
// Bonus: include support for negative indices, representing offsets
// from string-end. Example: String.slice(-1) returns the stringâ€™s last
// character.

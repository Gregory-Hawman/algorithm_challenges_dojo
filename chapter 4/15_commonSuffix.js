// Lance is writing his opus: Epitome, an epic tome of beat poetry.
// Always ready for a good rhyme, he constantly seeks words that end
// with the same letters. Write a function that, when given a word array,
// returns the largest suffix (word-end) common to all words in the
// array. For inputs ["deforestation", "citation", "conviction",
// "incarceration"], return "tion" (not all that creative a rhyming point).
// If it is ["nice", "ice", "baby"], return "", because that’s just … not.

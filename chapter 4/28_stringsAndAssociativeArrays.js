// This weekend, go online and find a long text file (such as http://www.classicreader.com/book/206/1, for example â€“ although any multi-page text would suffice). We want to do some analysis on this text! Find a way to get the text into your JavaScript code, and then determine the following:

//     How many letters (including spaces) are in the text? How many words? 
//     How many unique letters are in the text? Ignoring punctuation, how many unique words?
//     What are the unique-letter and unique-word results if you ignore capitalization?
//     List all the unique words in alphabetical order. Put them into an array in this order.
//     What are the ten most common words in this text? How frequently do each of them occur?
//     Create an array of unique words and number of appearances, in ascending count order. What is your best choice of data structure here?

// String.split(separator,limit) - split string into an array of substrings,
// returning array.
// Separator specifies where to divide substrings and is not included in
// any substring. If "" is specified, split the string on every character.
// Limit is optional and indicates number of splits; additional post-limit
// items should be discarded. Note: existing string is unaffected.

Strings and Associative Arrays Review
In this chapter, we learned about the string data type: how to access
specific characters, determine the length, and use built-in string
functions. We learned about the switch statement, as well as the
concepts of fast-finish and fast-fail. We introduced the concept of
associative arrays (and objects, which are the closest concept in
JavaScript to an associative array). We also discovered the FOR..IN
loop and used it to iterate through the keys (not values) of an object.

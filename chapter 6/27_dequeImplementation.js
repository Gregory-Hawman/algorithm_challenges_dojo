// [] Deque: Implementation
// Having combined the designs of Stack and Queue, why not combine
// features as well. Let’s create a class Deque (pronounced ‘deck’)
// representing a double-ended queue. On top of the basic six
// methods, enable it to push and pop from opposite ends. Specifically,
// build class Deque with pushFront(val), pushBack(val), popFront(),
// popBack(), front(), back(), contains(val), isEmpty(), and size().

// [] Compare Stacks
// Given two Stack objects, create a standalone function to return
// whether they are equal. Stacks are equal only if they have equal
// elements in identical order. You can use an additional third Stack for
// storage; you will need it because you must return the given Stacks to
// their original condition upon exit.

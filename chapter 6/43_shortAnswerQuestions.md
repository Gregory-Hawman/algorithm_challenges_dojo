With short answer questions, you can demonstrate technical depth as well as clarity of communication. How would you answer the following, if asked in an interview?

� Short Answer Questions: Queues and Stacks
What is a Queue? When would I use one?

What’s the best way to implement a Queue?

Can you implement this a different way? How would you do this, and why?

Is there such thing as ‘unbalanced’ Queue?

For a list-based Queue that contains the following methods – push, pop, top, min, max, size, contains, prevVal/nextVal – which of these are considered relatively fast?

Conversely, which of these methods would be considered relatively slow? How slow?

Would you change this implementation if your list-based Queue required rapid sequential access in both the forward and reverse directions (removeFirst, removeLast)? How?

When would a list-based Queue be considered ‘full’?

For an array-based Queue that contains the following methods – push, pop, top, min, max, size, contains, prevVal/nextVal – which of these are considered relatively fast?

Conversely, which of these methods would be considered relatively slow? How slow?

Would you change this implementation if your array-based Queue required rapid sequential access in both the forward and reverse directions (removeFirst, removeLast)? How?

When would an array-based Queue be considered ‘full’?

What is a Stack? When would I use one?

What is the most common underlying implementation for a Stack?

When and why would you choose to implement this differently?

For a Stack built with common implementation, containing the following methods – push, pop, top, min, max, size, contains, prevVal/nextVal – which methods are considered relatively fast?

Likewise, which of these methods are considered relatively slow? How slow?

Is there such thing as ‘unbalanced’ Stack?

When would this type of Stack be considered ‘full’?

Is there such thing as a hybrid Queue/Stack? Does it have a
name?

How are these most commonly implemented? Is there more than one common implementation?

// [] Stack: Mirror
// Anna has a curiosity with numbers and strings that are the same
// forwards and backwards. Mirror a Stackâ€™s existing values onto itself,
// in reverse. Sending Stack (1,3,5,7) to your function should change it
// to (1,3,5,7,7,5,3,1). Use one other Stack or Queue (not both) for
// storage.

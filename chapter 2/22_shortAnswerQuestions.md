What is the JavaScript Math library? What does it contain?
Why aren’t all those functions just included in JavaScript
automatically?
If I call Math.random(), what will it return?
What do the following functions do: Math.floor, Math.ceil,
Math.trunc, Math.round?
When do Math.floor and Math.trunc not return the same value?
What is the % operator? When is it useful?
How do I make variables declared outside (right next to) a
function visible inside it?
Why should I comment my code? If I know what it does, isn’t
commenting just a waste of time?

Fundamentals Part II Review
The two chapters prior to this one rapidly introduced you to many
important concepts that underlie all of computing. These include
source code, programming languages, code flow, variables and data
types (such as numbers, booleans and strings), conditionals,
operators (such as =, ==, ===, &&, ||, !, +=, ++, -=, -- and %), loops
(including FOR, WHILE, BREAK, CONTINUE), creating and
executing your own functions (including input parameters and the
return value), arrays, T-diagrams and comments.
This chapter added numerical tools to our palettes: including the
floor, ceil, round, trunc and random functions from the Math library.
We learned about the % operator, which is invaluable for
determining remainders, or for extracting digits or fractional values
from a compound number. We also were introduced to the concept
of scope: a variable declared within a function is not visible outside it,
but a variable declared outside a function can be visible inside it.
You are now fully equipped to solve a very broad number of basic
computing challenges! There are still many more concepts for you to
learn, so don’t be discouraged if you go looking for interesting
algorithm problems only to find that many of them are confusing or
too difficult. Over time, with more repetition and practice, as these
ideas sink in, and as we add more of these concepts, you will
become better and better at breaking problems into understandable
pieces that you can conquer with confidence. Onward!

// Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline.
// Letâ€™s say you are given an array with heights of consecutive
// buildings, starting closest to you and extending away. Array [-1,7,3]
// would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below
// street level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories
// high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated at street level.
// Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order.
// Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4]. As always with
// challenges, do not use built-in array functions such as unshift().
